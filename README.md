This guide explains how to install Reacher on an OVH dedicated server.

## Requirements

* Create an account on https://www.ovhcloud.com.
* Buy a dedicated server. I do not recommend using a VPS, as you will be sharing the same IP address with other customers, which can make email verification results unreliable. Computation power is often not the bottleneck, so you can get the cheap dedicated Eco servers.
* Make sure you have the correct license to self-host, see the [Self-Host Guide](link-to-self-host-guide).
* (Only if you want to enable bulk email verification) Have access to a PostgreSQL database. Heroku offers some for free.

## ü§ì Step by Step Guide

1. **Set up your dedicated server** by following the official OVH documentation. I recommend "Debian 11" as the Linux distribution, but it should work with "Debian 10" too.
2. **Log into your server:**

   ```bash
   ssh debian@<ip_address_of_your_server>
Create the file ovh_postinstall.sh and paste the following content into it. You can use vim or nano to do this. Configure the variables at the top of the file accordingly.

Bash
#!/bin/bash

# Postinstall script of Reacher Backend on an OVH debian 11 server.
# As a postinstall, this script is meant to be run once, but for convenience,
# it's actually idempotent.

# Fail early.
set -e

# TODO: Configure these variables.
# Required variables:
RCH_VERSION="v0.7.0"                      # Docker Hub tag for reacherhq/backend.
DATABASE_URL="{{{DATABASE_URL}}}"          # URL of a Postgres database which hosts the bulk queue and results.
# Optional variables
RCH_SENTRY_DSN="{{{RCH_SENTRY_DSN}}}"      # Send bug reports to a Sentry.io dashboard.
RCH_HEADER_SECRET="{{{RCH_HEADER_SECRET}}}"  # Protect backend from the public.
RCH_FROM_EMAIL=reacher@gmail.com
RCH_HELLO_NAME=gmail.com                   # Should ideally match the reverse DNS of your OVH cloud instance.

echo "Installing Reacher backend $RCH_VERSION on host $HOSTNAME..."

Use code with caution.

Make the script executable:

Bash
chmod a+x ovh_postinstall.sh
Use code with caution.

Run the script:

Bash
./ovh_postinstall.sh
Use code with caution.

Wait a couple of minutes until the script finishes. It should end with:

--snip--
<long_hexadecimal_string>
Everything set. You can close this terminal.
The long hexadecimal string represents the Docker container ID, should you wish to start/stop it or monitor its logs.

In a new terminal, test the server by sending an email verification request:

Bash
curl -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"to_email":"amaury@reacher.email"}' \
    http://<ip_address_of_your_server>/v0/check_email
Use code with caution.

It should return a JSON with is_reachable=safe!

Next Steps
Your server is now correctly set up.

If you want to configure it more, take a look at some configuration options.
Instead of single email verifications as in step 6, try bulk email verification after setting the RCH_ENABLE_BULK environment variable to 1.
